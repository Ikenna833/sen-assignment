Student Result Management System (SRMS)

Project Description

The Student Result Management System (SRMS) is a simple Python-based application designed to manage student results by allowing users to input student names and scores, automatically assign grades, and display all results. The system helps in reducing manual result processing and ensures accuracy.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

This project follows the standard SDLC phases as outlined below:

⸻

1. Planning

Objective

To design and develop a simple system that can:
	•	Accept student names and scores
	•	Automatically assign grades
	•	Display all student results

Scope

The system will be implemented using Python and will run in a console environment.

⸻

2. Requirement Analysis

Functional Requirements
	•	The system shall allow the user to add a student name.
	•	The system shall allow the user to input a student score.
	•	The system shall automatically compute grades.
	•	The system shall display all saved student results.

Non-Functional Requirements
	•	The system should be easy to use.
	•	The system should be fast and responsive.
	•	The system should work offline.
	•	The system should be implemented using Python.

⸻

3. System Design

Architecture

The system is divided into three main modules:
	•	Input Module: Accepts student name and score.
	•	Processing Module: Calculates grade based on score.
	•	Output Module: Displays student results.

Flow of Operation

User Input → Process Score → Assign Grade → Display Result

4. Implementation

The system is implemented using Python.

Key Features
	•	Menu-driven interface
	•	Automatic grade computation
	•	Stores multiple student records in memory

Technologies Used
	•	Programming Language: Python
	•	Platform: Console-based application
5. Testing

6. Deployment

The system is deployed by:
	•	Uploading the project to GitHub
	•	Running the program on any computer with Python installed

⸻

7. Maintenance

Future improvements may include:
	•	Saving results to a file or database
	•	Adding a graphical user interface (GUI)
	•	Implementing login and authentication
	•	Generating printable reports

⸻

Conclusion

The Student Result Management System demonstrates the practical application of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) in developing a simple and effective software solution for managing student results.
